This repository is on a game rock/paper/siccor

This is a Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player faces off against the computer. The player selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, while the computer makes a random choice. The game follows these rules:

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beats Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
The game declares the winner after each round, and handles invalid inputs. It's simple, fun, and allows players to play multiple rounds in a row!
